          A SIMPLE IMPLICIT SOLVER

Write a C++ code to solve the ODE  dy/dx=y+y^2. Let the 
initial condition be that y=1/2 at x=0. This is to be solved
by a first order IMPLICIT method. (NOTE: You will not have 
to use Newton's method, or any other solver for this problem.)

Your program should solve and produce output data for x from 0 to 1.
(Be careful. The solution should diverge at x around 1.099.)

Your program should ask the user to choose N the number of steps to 
be taken, and should generate an output file "out.dat" that has 
3 columns: x, computed y, exact y (from the analytic solution).
