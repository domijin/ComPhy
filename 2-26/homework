You have been given the program evenspacedLagrange.cpp.  This uses GSL
functions to give an even-spaced Lagrangian interpolation for the
function x*exp(-20x^2) on the interval -1<x<+1.  Write a program to do
10 pt Lagrangian interpolation of that function, again on -1<x<+1 for
Chebyshev nodes rather than evenly spaced nodes.

You should provide: a program Cheb.cpp that writes to a file
interp.dat, in two column format, the polynomial interpolation x,y on
-1<x<+1.  [HINT: This should be an easy modification of the program
evenspacedLagrange.cpp.]  You should also provide a single graph, as
shown in class, that shows the following functions, all plotted on
-1<x<1: (i) The function x*exp(-20x^2). (ii) The polynomial approximation
given by the evenly spaced Lagrangian interpolation. (iii) The polynomial
approximation given by the interpolation using Chebyshev nodes.
