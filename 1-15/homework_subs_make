Now write a single program that calls an external function.  It can
call one external function to solve for the rooot near 2.42, and
another to solve for the root near 1.15. Write a makefile 
that can compile the program to run with one or the other 
external function, with the change being made only by moving
the comment character from one line to another in the Makefile.
