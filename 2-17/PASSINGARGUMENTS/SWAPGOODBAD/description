testgood.cpp:

The main calls for the function swap with the parameters expressed by
address. swap defines its inputs to be addresses. The "temporary"
variables a and b are defined as addresses, and the action of swap is
to interchance the values stored at those addresses. It works and it
all makes sense.

testbad.cpp

Again, the main calls for the function swap with the parameters expressed by
address. Again, swap defines its inputs to be addresses. Here, however, the 
temporary variables a,b are defined as addresses. The action of swap is to interchange the values at these addresses. Thus the value stored in v becomes the value stored in b, etc.   This program crashes.  WHY?
