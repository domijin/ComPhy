You have an infinite pile of cards with numbers 0 through 9.
There are twice as many cards with numbers from 5 to 9
as there are from 0 to 4.

Write a program that asks for N, the number of cards chosen.
The program should output the number of "low" cards chosen,
and the number of "high" cards chosen, and should output 
the average numerical value chosen.
