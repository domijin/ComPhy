Demonstration of the simple use of a struct
The idea is that the struct contains a double x and an int n.
The action of a function "raise" is to multiply the double x
by itself n times.


compile with g++ structdemo1.cpp
run with a.out

This is an alternative syntax for introducing the structure of a struct.
It is a rather "Cish" syntax, but is on note because it is what is mostly 
used in the header files of the gsl inludes.
*****************/

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
/********* Define struct data type *****/
typedef struct paer{//This defines the struct type "paer."
//I couldn't use "pair" since that already had a meaning in C
double x;
int n;
} paer;

/******* Define function that uses the struct data type 
What's going on here is that we define a function "raise" 
that takes as input "bpair" which is of datatype "par".
In the function cll, "m" is a placeholder. Below we will
use actual data of type "paer." This is the variable "apair."
****/
double raise(paer bpair)
{double prod=1.;
for(int k=0;k<bpair.n;++k){
prod=prod*bpair.x;}
 return(prod);}//returns x^n

int main(){
paer apair;  //defines "apair" to be a struct of the paer type.
apair.x=4.5;
apair.n=2;
 cout<<raise(apair)<<endl;//function is called with only struct argument
  return(0);}
