1. L2 error for N = 20 is 0.037403713
2. The smallest value of N for which the L2 error is less than 0.01 is 40
3. L2 error as N varies from N = 10 to N = 1000 become smaller if double float precision is kept from datagenerator.cpp to LUdecomp.cpp, otherwise the roundoff error will somehow starting to affect the improvince of accuracy. Accuracy improving trend see /trend/data for N from 4 to 1599
