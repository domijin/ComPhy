	HOMEWORK SET 4
        ----------------
In this homework set, and all subsequent homework sets, organize
your submission as follows:
(i)  create a directory "HomeworkSet_4"
(ii) create subdirectories PROB_1, PROB_2, etc.
(iii)put materials in the appropriate subdirectories
(iv) make a tarball hwset4.tgz of  HomeworkSet_4 and email it 
                 to me.

PROBLEM 1 (10 points)
--------------------
With this problem you will finish the exercise we started in
class working with nonuniform distributions.

You have an infinite pile of cards with numbers 0 through 9.
There are twice as many cards with numbers from 5 to 9
as there are from 0 to 4.

Write a program, nonuniform.cpp, that asks for N, the number of cards
chosen.  The program should output the number of "low" cards (0 to 4)
chosen, and the number of "high" cards chosen (5-14), and should
output the average numerical value of the N cards chosen.

Hand in: your program nonuniform.cpp
***** Sample output ****************

prompt% a.out
 How many times do you want to run the experiment?
10

number of low cards= 3 number of high cards= 7
 Averge= 5.5

PROBLEM 2 (20 points)
--------------------

On Monday, Jan 27, we worked with the program binom.cpp.
I demonstrated a program, binom_forplot.cpp, that did 
the same computation, but then output the results in 
an external file named "real.dat."  The program also
uses the computed mean and variance to generate
a gaussian distribution with those values of the mean
and the variance.  The program then generates an
external file "ideal.dat."  The two external files
can be put into a plotting routine to generate the 
"real" values and the "ideal" values, as shown in class.

Hand in: 
     Your program binom_forplot.cpp
     real.dat
     ideal.dat
     A graphical version of a plot with both curves
     (the plot can be a pdf, ps, jpeg, gif, or png)

PROBLEM 3 (40 points)
--------

Look up the method for fourth-order Runge-Kutta solutions to
first-order ordinary differential equations.  You will find many
hits on the web. "RK4" is probably the most widely used approach
for solving ODEs.A good, clear, straightforward reference is the
numerical-methods section of the Abramowicz & Stegun "Handbook" at
  http://apps.nrbook.com/abramowitz_and_stegun/index.html
You will find the appropriate method on p.896, formula 25.5.10.

You will be writing a program rk4solver.cpp that solves a differential equation
        y'=f(x,y)
with the function f(x,y) that is in an external file named function.cpp. 
Your rk4solver.cpp program should be able to solve any first order diff eq
that can be put into the form y'=f(x,y). You should write a Makefile that compiles and links the two programs.

Your program's features should be as follows:
* It should ask the user for xin the starting value of x and xfin, the final
value of x. 

* It should ask the user for the starting value of y.

* It should ask the user for the value of the integer N that is the number 
of divisions into which the range of x is to be divided. Note that 
       h=(xfin-xin)/N

* It should print out the value of the solution at xfin, that is, it 
should print out the computed value of y(xfin). It should do this
printout with 14 decimal places. To see how to do this, look up 
the C instruction: "printf"


* It should have an option flag -r. If this flag is set, the program should 
Richardsonize the rk4 results and print out both the rk4 value 
of y(xfin) and the Richardsonized value of y(xfin).

* You should choose the function f so that you will be solving the diff eq
                     dy/dx+y*sin(x)=y^2*e^x



NOTE: TO SEE HOW TO SET FLAGS, LOOK AT THE PROGRAM secant.cpp THAT 
WAS HANDED OUT.

Hand in: Your program rk4solver.cpp
                      function.cpp
                      Makefile
